            is the ongoing sixth concert tour by the American singer-songwriter
            Taylor Swift, who described it as a journey through all of her
            "musical eras". A homage to her 10-album discography, the Eras Tour
            is Swift's most expansive tour yet, with 151 shows across five
            continents.
